1️ What is the Java Collections Framework?

The Java Collections Framework (JCF) is a set of interfaces and classes that
 store and manipulate groups of objects in a standardized way.

 Collection heirarchy

 Iterable
   → Collection
         → List
         → Set
         → Queue
         → Deque
 2 Difference between Collection and Collections?
   Collection	                            Collections
   Extends Iterable                         Extends Object
   Interface	                           Utility (helper) class
   Represents a group of objects	Has static methods like sort(), reverse(), shuffle()
   Can include abstract, default,          Only Static methods
   and static methods (since Java 8)


 3 | Type     | Stores          | Order          | Duplicates            |
   | -------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
   | **List** | Elements        | Ordered        | Yes                   |
   | **Set**  | Elements        | Not guaranteed | No                    |
   | **Map**  | Key-Value pairs | Not guaranteed | Keys: No, Values: Yes |

4| Iterator                  | ListIterator           |
 | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
 | Works on List, Set, Queue | Works only on List     |
 | Forward only              | Forward + backward     |
 | Only remove()             | add(), set(), remove() |
