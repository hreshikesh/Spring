            X-workz, also known as X-workz Omkar Development Centre, is a well-established computer training institute
            primarily located in Bangalore, India. It specializes in bridging the gap between academic knowledge and the
            practical skills required by the IT industry. The institute is particularly well-regarded for its in-depth,
            hands-on training programs in core and advanced Java, along with a wide range of other modern web
            technologies and frameworks.

            The institute's mission is to equip individuals, especially recent graduates and freshers, with the
            technical and professional skills needed for a successful career in software development. They achieve this
            by offering a curriculum that focuses on real-time projects, providing mock interviews, and offering
            placement assistance. The trainers are often experienced professionals from the IT industry, ensuring that
            the knowledge imparted is current and relevant to industry standards. X-workz's reputation is built on its
            practical approach to education, aiming to prepare students not just for interviews, but for the actual
            demands of a developer's role..........
